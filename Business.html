                    <p>Yet, over the past year dozens of new carriers have started up around the world, hoping that air
                        travel is about to take
                        off again.
                    
                        "It's actually a very good time to launch an airline," says Bjorn Tore Larsen, chief executive of
                        Norse Atlantic
                        Airways. "There is a huge pent up demand. People haven't been able to travel for two years or more,
                        particularly between
                        continents."</p>
